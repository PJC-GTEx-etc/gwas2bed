To be meaningful, it would have to be normalized (highest value is self-self)Min MIM - same here, except as I mentioned, it will be geometric distributionShared rels - importantly, this matrix is asymmetric. for example, breast cancer has the most relationships of all cancer types. If you go to the breast cancer (BC) *row*, you will see lower values than if you go to the breast cancer *column*. What this means is that, of all the relationships BC has, other cancers tend to overlap with this list less (BC row values). Conversely, if you take the total relationships for any cancer, a large fraction overlap with the BC literature (BC column values). So, for example, of all the relationships carcinoid tumors have in the literature, 80% overlap with BC. But, of all the relationships BC has (which is a lot), only 3.46% overlap with carcinoid.`iridescent.txt` - autoimmune terms lit. similarity data
