[Supplemental table 1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nature13835-s1.xls) has genomic coordinates of disease-associated SNPs.

Prerequisites: Download [Supplemental table 1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nature13835-s1.xls) and save it as text file into a folder, such as *bed*.

Copy *Makefile* into that folder and run `make`. It will extract disease-specific SNPs into separate BED files.
