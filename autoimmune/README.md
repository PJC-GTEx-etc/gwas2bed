### [db_delRosario](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n5/full/nmeth.3326.html) - regulatory SNPs associated with autoimmune diseases.

del Rosario RC-H, Poschmann J, Rouam SL, Png E, Khor CC, Hibberd ML, Prabhakar S: **Sensitive detection of chromatin-altering polymorphisms reveals autoimmune disease mechanisms**. Nat Methods 2015, 12.

`nmeth.3326-S2.xlsx` - Supplementary Table 3: List of SNPs that are haQTLs. The table contains the hg19 coordinates of the haQTLs, the raw P-values, the FDR Q-values and the parameters ascertained by the G-SCI test.

`nmeth.3326-S3.xlsx` - Supplementary Table 5: List of autoimmune GWAS SNPs. Sheet 1 (GWAS SNPs in LD with QTLs): autoimmune GWAS SNPs that are in strong LD with the regulatory QTL sets. Sheet 2 (All GWAS SNPs): the 831 autoimmune GWAS SNPS used in the analysis, 79 diseases.

### [db_Farh](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature13835.pdf) - SNPs associated with 39 diseases

Farh KK-H, Marson A, Zhu J, Kleinewietfeld M, Housley WJ, Beik S, Shoresh N, Whitton H, Ryan RJH, Shishkin A a., Hatan M, Carrasco-Alfonso MJ, Mayer D, Luckey CJ, Patsopoulos N a., De Jager PL, Kuchroo VK, Epstein CB, Daly MJ, Hafler D a., Bernstein BE: **Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants**. Nature 2014

`nature13835-s1.xls` - hg19 genomic coordinates of 39 disease-associated SNPs.

`make` will extract disease-specific SNPs into separate BED files. It also contains a command for making pair-wise overlap counts, stored in `overlapMatrix.txt` file.

### [db_Sjogren](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep18855) - Sjogren's syndrome associated genes

Fang K, Zhang K, Wang J. **Network-assisted analysis of primary Sj√∂gren's
syndrome GWAS data in Han Chinese**. Sci Rep. 2015 Dec 21;5:18855. doi:
10.1038/srep18855. PubMed PMID: 26686423.

`Sjogren_genes.xlsx` - 71 Sjogren's associated genes, obtained using PPI. hg19 genomic coordinates
