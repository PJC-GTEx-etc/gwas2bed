[Jerez, A., Rubin, L., Li, X., & Xu, C. (n.d.). Genome-wide methylome analyses reveal novel epigenetic regulation patterns in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/aa/201587/)

Supplementary tables 1 and 3 have genomic coordinates of  hyper/hypomethylated DMRs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively. Note, coordinates are in hg18 genome assembly. 

`make dmr_sz_pb` will download the supplementary material and extract those two files, in .xls format. Extract genomic coordinates manually.

Number of DMRs:
    - 128 bp_hyper.bed
    - 198 bp_hypo.bed
    - 351 sz_hyper.bed
    - 602 sz_hypo.bed
