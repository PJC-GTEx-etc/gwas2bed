[Jerez, A., Rubin, L., Li, X., & Xu, C. (n.d.). Genome-wide methylome analyses reveal novel epigenetic regulation patterns in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/aa/201587/)

Supplementary tables 1 and 3 have genomic coordinates of  hyper/hypomethylated DMRs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively. Note, coordinates are in hg18 genome assembly. 

`make dmr_sz_pb` will download the supplementary material and extract those two files, in .xls format. Extract genomic coordinates manually.

Number of DMRs:
    - 128 bp_hyper.bed
    - 198 bp_hypo.bed
    - 351 sz_hyper.bed
    - 602 sz_hypo.bed

Supplementary Table 5: Independent loci from the Discovery samples after clumping (50 Mb and r2 > 0.3). SNPs with p < 1.00E-6 for each phenotype are shown. `suppl5.bed` - 34 loci

Supplementary Table 8: SNPs with previously published candidate associations to neuroimaging phenotypes. SNPs with P-values < 0.05 in the Discovery sample are highlighted, none were genome-wide significant (P < 5x10-8). `suppl5.bed` - 39 loci.

Supplementary Table 9: Previously Published Genome Wide Significant Look-up Table. SNPs with P-values < 0.05 within the discovery sample are highlighted. Several disorders had no genome-wide significant and replicated common SNP variants reported as of August 8, 2014: Autism (PMID: 22843504), OCD (PMID: 22889921), ADHD (PMID: 20732625), and MDD (PMID: 22472876). `suppl9.bed` - 156 loci
