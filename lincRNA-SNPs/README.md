Phenotype-associated SNPs in human lincRNAs database
========================================================

List of disease-associated rsIDs and corresponding lincRNAs from 
[LincSNP](http://210.46.85.180:8080/LincSNP/home.jsp) database

`Makefile` - downloads list of SNPs

ToDo: Need to process this file into separate disease-specific BED files, rsIDs need to be mapped to genomic coordinates
